# Tools Not Included
Tools Not Included (https://toolsnotincluded.net) is a website with tools for the game [Oxygen Not Included](https://klei.com/games/oxygen-not-included) by Klei.
Currently it features a [Map Browser](#tools-not-included-seed-browser) and [World Trait Tools]() but will be expanded with more tools in the future.

## [Map Browser](https://toolsnotincluded.net/map-tools/map-browser)
The Map Browser is a place for people to browse and share game world maps. The maps can be filtered by a set of rules: combination of counts of geysers, planets, geyser outputs or world traits.  
The map can be uploaded to the database using the [dedicated mods](https://toolsnotincluded.net/map-tools/map-browser/contribute)

### Current mod versions
* Manual mod: v2 (19th Aug 2019)
* Automatic mod: v2 (19th Aug 2019)

## [World Trait Tools](https://toolsnotincluded.net/map-tools/world-trait-finder)
World Trait tools provide info about existing world traits, allow generating seed numbers with specified sets of traits and checking traits for a given seed number.
